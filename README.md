# Gym
**Webpage for my gym business**

1) I originally wrote this code to familiarize myself with html css and javascript and I had no plans of creating a repository for it. However, I am currently a junior at the university of pittsburgh and I really want a summer internship, so I am creating this repository in hopes an employer seeing promise in my skills. Please be aware that this project was a learning process more than a finished product and I am fully self taught in web development.

2) I used to own a gym (that is where the pictures are from) and I tried to design a website that would be useful for that buisness. The home page has a button that theoretically would allow a user to book an appointment in the gym. The contact page has all of my information. There is an about me page to give them some information about me. Finally, there is a workout generator page that is not hooked up to any code right now (i plan on changing that though). I wrote a Java program that generated workouts very efficiently, I just need to convert that to javascript and hook it up to the buttons. However, for our purposes, I hope that the code here ( along with the version control) shows enough promise to get me an internship in my field.

3) If anyone took the time to read this, thank you.
